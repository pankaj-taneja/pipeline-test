/*
This is a sample Jenkinsfile to demonstrate the list of stages
that should be implemented for continuous integration and continuous
deployment of a RPM artifact.
This pipeline expects following branch names in GitHub repository
that has to be followed:
master
feature/JIRA-ID-Description
fix/JIRA-ID-Description
release/X.Y.Z

This pipeline also implements stages for pull requests testing
hence it is strongly recommended to follow pull request practices.
Which is: Nothing can be merged into master or release branch without
creating a pull request.

Pipeline follows following Artifact versioning strategy which in
this case is a RPM package promotion to different repos in artifactory:
If Branch Name is feature/JIRA-ID-Description or fix/JIRA-ID-Description
  then, RPMVersion = JIRA-ID (From branch name, ephemeral Artifact) which is to
  be pushed in application-repo-name/ephemeral repo.
If Branch Name is PR-ID
  then, RPMVersion = PR-ID (From PR name, ephemeral Artifact) which is to
  be pushed in application-repo-name/ephemeral repo.
If Branch Name is master or release,
  then, RPMVersion = <module vesion>-<currentBuild number> which is to be
  pushed in application-repo-name/dev repo.
After dev test, same rpm to be copied to application-repo-name/qa repo.
After QA test, same rpm to be copied to application-repo-name/rc repo.
After Acceptance test, same rpm to be copied to application-repo-name/prod repo.

* Ephemeral artifacts created with feature or fix Branches
 and with pull should get deleted after closure of the
 branch/PR.
* Note that docker tags promotion on master or release branches
does not create separate artifacts but a different tag to
the same docker image which should be kept until the image is
in use.
